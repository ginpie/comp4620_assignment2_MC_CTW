class MC_AIXI_CTW_Agent(agent.Agent):
    """ This class represents a MC-AIXI-CTW agent.

        It includes much of the high-level logic for choosing suitable actions.
        In particular, the agent maintains an internal model of the environment using
        a context tree.

        It uses this internal model to to predict the probability of future outcomes:

         - `get_predicted_action_probability()`
         - `percept_probability()`

        as well as to generate actions and precepts according to the model distribution:

         - `generate_action()`
         - `gen_percept()`
         - `generate_percept_and_update()`
         - `generate_random_action()`

        Actions are chosen via the UCT algorithm, which is orchestrated by a
        high-level search function and a playout policy:

         - `search()`
         - `playout()`
         - `horizon`
         - `mc_simulations`
         - `search_tree`

        Several functions decode/encode actions and percepts between the
        corresponding types (i.e. `action_enum`, `percept_enum`) and generic
        representation by symbol lists:

         - `decode_action()`
         - `decode_observation()`
         - `decode_percept()`
         - `decode_reward()`
         - `encode_action()`
         - `encode_percept()`

        There are various attributes which describe the agent and its
        interaction with the environment so far:

         - `age`
         - `average_reward`
         - `history_size()`
         - `horizon`
         - `last_update`
         - `maximum_action()`
         - `maximum_bits_needed()`
         - `maximum_reward()`
         - `total_reward`
